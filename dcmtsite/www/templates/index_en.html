<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p> Department of&nbsp;computational methods and turbulence for more than ten years
has been continuing the work started by&nbsp;O.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Belotserkovsky in&nbsp;the Institute. The Department 
successfully solves the current computational problems of&nbsp;continuum mechanics using the most recent 
techniques and technologies.</p>
<p>Head of&nbsp;the Department: Prof. O.V. Troshkin.</p>

<h2>ICAD RAS</h2>		 
<p> ICAD RAS is&nbsp;maintaining relationship with more than 20&nbsp;Russian and foreign organizations, including 
which MSU, MIPT, MEPHI, TSAGI, Kurchatov Institute, Keldysh Institute of&nbsp;Applied Mathematics (IPM),
A.A. Dorodnitsyn Computational Centre (CC), RICCR, Center for Development of&nbsp;Advanced Computing Systems S-DAS (Pune, India), 
International Institute of&nbsp;Information Technologies (Pune, India), Nagoya University (Japan) and Abdus Salam International Centre for
Theoretical Physics in&nbsp;Trieste (Italy). Students and postgraduates of&nbsp;leading technical universities of&nbsp;Russia study at&nbsp;IAP RAS. 
Young professionals are involved to&nbsp;solve urgent problems of&nbsp;modern information technologies development. </p>
<p>A&nbsp;special role in&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;IAP RAS belongs to&nbsp;academician Oleg Belotserkovsky, who
was the Director of&nbsp;the Institute from the moment of&nbsp;its establishment till 2009. His research interests included
mathematical modeling of&nbsp;problems of&nbsp;hydrophysics, turbulence, multidimensional problems of&nbsp;plasma physics
(in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;the problem of&nbsp;laser thermonuclear fusion), problems of&nbsp;mechanics of&nbsp;deformable solid
bodies, mathematical modeling of&nbsp;various medical and biological processes, development of&nbsp;common approaches
to&nbsp;solve the problem of&nbsp;scaling numerical methods to&nbsp;the architecture of&nbsp;high-performance computers (supercomputers).
O.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Belotserkovsky created a&nbsp;large school in&nbsp;the field of&nbsp;computational mechanics. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the author of&nbsp;more than 340 scientific
works, including a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;fundamental monographs, which set out new computational models
and the results of&nbsp;solving various nonlinear problems of&nbsp;continuum mechanics and plasma physics obtained,
based on&nbsp;mathematical modeling and computational experiments.</p>
