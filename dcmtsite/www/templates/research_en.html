<h1>DIRECTIONS OF&nbsp;RESEARCH</h1>
<blockquote><p>&quot; Based on&nbsp;the world experience of&nbsp;the industrially advanced countries, i.e. USA and Europe, the long-term (25-30&nbsp;years)
Russian industrial policy should be&nbsp;aimed to&nbsp;creation and support of&nbsp;the backbone of&nbsp;high-tech industry, science and education in&nbsp;Russia
&mdash;&nbsp;backbone companies&nbsp;&mdash; analogues of&nbsp;900&nbsp;US companies and, first of&nbsp;all, in&nbsp;such high-priority sectors as&nbsp;nuclear
energy, aviation, shipbuilding. The main objectives of&nbsp;these companies for the next 10-15 years
consists the implementation of&nbsp;the Russian business model &laquo;knowledge economy&raquo;, the creation of
world-competitive final products (nuclear power plants, aircraft, ships), capturing
a&nbsp;significant share of&nbsp;the relevant niche of&nbsp;the world market, providing
financial flows from the sale of&nbsp;serial products of&nbsp;stable employment and income
state and system-formation companies.&quot; </p>
